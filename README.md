**INTRODUCTION**


Cheforces is an **analyser** website for coding platforms like codeforces and codechef . The main objective of the website is to provide  detailed analysis of a user  on codeforces/codechef given username of the user . You can also see the list of upcoming and past contests on both the platforms. 
Currently we are trying to extend the website to give overall performance analysis about a particular user in a given contest . Also we are trying to extend the platform to other competitive coding platforms like codechef and Hackerrank.
